# Smiley

I'll practice working with a BMP file and change all the black pixels to a color.

The smiley face is not just made of of 0’s and 1’s, or black and white pixels, but consists of 24 bits per pixel. It uses eight bits to represent red values, eight bits for green and eight bits for blue. Since each color uses eight bits or one byte, we can use a number in the range of 0 to 255 to represent its color value. In hexadecimal, this is represented by 0x00 to 0xff. By mixing together these red, green and blue values, we can create millions of possible colors.
